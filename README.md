# PEF-RISC-V
The goal of this project is to influence the RISC-V open source community by creating a the first VM-based TEE for the RISC-V processor.   The target environments for the VM-based TEEs are cloud and edge computing.

Firmware for OpenPower systems.

## Building

Any host OS can build and test Ultravisor provided it has a C cross compiler
for *big endian* powerpc64. 

(The little-endian powerpc64le compilers in Ubuntu and Fedora are actually
bi-endian and can compile Ultravisor even though it's big-endian. We recommend
installing a little-endian toolchain if you plan on building other projects.)


### Define CROSS environment variable if needed

```
export CROSS=powerpc64le-linux-gnu-
```

### Make ultra.lid

```
$ make
```

## Hacking

Ultravisor follows the Linux kernel coding style. Ultravisor source tree
contains a `.clang-format` file based on the Linux kernel provided one.
